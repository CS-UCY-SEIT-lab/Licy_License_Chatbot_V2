To find its license, look for a file called <code class='language-plaintext highlighter-rouge'>LICENSE</code> or <code class='language-plaintext highlighter-rouge'>COPYING</code>, and skim the project’s <code class='language-plaintext highlighter-rouge'>README</code>. </p> <p>Depending on the original project’s license, using the same license might be a requirement, not just the easiest thing to do. </p> <p>Some communities have strong preferences for particular licenses. If you want to participate in one of these, it will be easier to use their preferred license, even if you’re starting a brand new project with no existing dependencies. Some examples include:</p> <ul class='bullets'> <li><span class='highlighted'>Apache</span> requires <span class='highlighted'>Apache License 2.0</span></li> <li><span class='highlighted'>Cloud Native Computing Foundation</span> requires <span class='highlighted'>Apache License 2.0</span></li> <li><span class='highlighted'>GNU</span> recommends <span class='highlighted'>GNU GPLv3</span> for most programs</li> <li><span class=''highlighted>npm packages</span> overwhelmingly use the <span class='highlighted'>MIT</span> or the very similar <span class='highlighted'>ISC</span> licenses</li> <li><span class='highlighted'>OpenBSD</span> prefers the <span class='highlighted'>ISC License</span></li> <li><span class='highlighted'>Rust</span> crates are overwhelmingly licensed <span class='highlighted'>MIT</span> <span class='highlighted'><code class='language-plaintext highlighter-rouge'>OR</code></span> <span class='highlighted'>Apache License 2.0</span></li> <li><span class='highlighted'>WordPress</span> plugins and themes must be <span class='highlighted'>GNU GPLv2</span> (or later)</li> <li><span class='highlighted'>Joomla</span> extensions and templates must be <span class='highlighted'>GNU GPLv2</span> for the PHP code.</li> </ul> <p>Communities come in all shapes and sizes, and more than one community might be pertinent (e.g., keep in mind <span class='highlighted'>your company</span> if you work for one).

    "I don't want to choose a license": {"type":"popup","content":"<h1>No License</h1> <p>When you make a creative work (which includes code), the work is under exclusive copyright by default. Unless you include a license that specifies otherwise, nobody else can copy, distribute, or modify your work without being at risk of take-downs, shake-downs, or litigation. Once the work has other contributors (each a copyright holder), “nobody” starts including you.</p> <p>Even in the absence of a license file, you may grant some rights in cases where you publish your source code to a site that requires accepting terms of service. For example, if you publish your source code in a public repository on GitHub, you have accepted the <span class='higlighted'>Terms of Service</span>, by which you allow others to view and fork your repository. Others may not need your permission if <span class='highlighted'>limitations and exceptions to copyright</span> apply to their particular situation. Neither site terms nor jurisdiction-specific copyright limitations are sufficient for the kinds of collaboration that people usually seek on a public code host, such as experimentation, modification, and sharing as fostered by an open source license.</p> <p>You don’t have to do anything to <em>not</em> offer a license. You may, however, wish to add a copyright notice and statement that you are not offering any license in a prominent place (e.g., your project’s README) so that <span class='highlighted'>users</span> don’t assume you made an oversight. If you’re going to accept others’ contributions to your non-licensed project, you may wish to explore adding a contributor agreement to your project with your lawyer so that you maintain copyright permission from contributors, even though you’re not granting the same.</p> <p>Disallowing use of your code might not be what you intend by “no license.” An <span class='highlighted'>open source license</span> allows reuse of your code while retaining copyright. If your goal is to completely opt-out of copyright restrictions, try a <span class='highlighted'>public domain dedication</span> instead.</p> <h2 id='for-users'>For users</h2> <p>If you find software that doesn’t have a license, that generally means you have no permission from the creators of the software to use, modify, or share the software.
