    "question_explanations":[
      "This question asks if you agree with others changing your code. Depending on your preference, you can allow full modifications, specific types of changes, or none at all.",
      "This question asks if others can use your software or modified versions (derivatives) to make profit. Allowing this may require charging a fee or offering specific terms.",
      "This question asks if programs combining your software can be kept closed-source (code hidden), or if the combined code must be openly shared.",
      "If you allow sublicensing, it means that others who get a license from you can grant different licenses than the one you used to others (sublicense).",
      "This question affects how modifications to your software are shared. You can require the same license you are using or allow different licenses.",
      "This question asks if you want users to mention changes they performed on your software when sharing your software or derivatives.",
      "This question applies to software accessed over a network (such as web applications). You can decide if the software will remain open source, even when users are interacting with the software over a network.",
      "This asks if you want legal protection for your software's code, features, or name. Copyright covers the code, patents protect specific functionalities, and trademarks safeguard unique names/logos.",
      "Even if you share your software, you can retain copyright unless stated otherwise. This allows you to claim ownership and potentially seek legal action if your rights are violated.",
      "If others contribute code to your project, you can decide if they retain patent rights related to their additions.",
      "This question asks if others can use your unique names or logos within their applications."
